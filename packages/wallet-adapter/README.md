# wallet adapter

The lion's share of focus has been on MyNEARWallet, since achieving that allows us to work backwards and ensure the rest work. I suspect I've missed a lot in the wallet side of this monorepo at the time of this writing. Good to keep in mind, and not worry that you're "doing something wrong" if you see an issue. ;)

## alpha version

The focus thus far has been of a highly technical nature, and after releasing this alpha version the devs will let their minds gestate. then this file will fill out with more meaningful info and snippets. 🙏🏼
